# Adeniyi Blog

This is a simple blog site built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Check out the documentation below to get started.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Clone repo

JS (official support)

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/teebarg/my-blog.git
```

2. Personalize `siteMetadata.js` (site related information)
3. Personalize `authors/default.md` (main author)
4. Modify `projectsData.js`
5. Modify `headerNavLinks.js` to customize navigation links
6. Add blog posts

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Extend / Customize

`data/siteMetadata.js` - contains most of the site related information which should be modified for a user's need.

`data/authors/default.md` - default author information (required). Additional authors can be added as files in `data/authors`.

`data/projectsData.js` - data used to generate styled card on the projects page.

`data/headerNavLinks.js` - navigation links.

`data/logo.svg` - replace with your own logo.

`data/blog` - replace with your own blog posts.

`public/static` - store assets such as images and favicons.

`tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css` - contain the tailwind stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of the site.

`css/prism.css` - controls the styles associated with the code blocks. Feel free to customize it and use your preferred prismjs theme e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

`components/social-icons` - to add other icons, simply copy an svg file from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and map them in `index.js`. Other icons use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).

`components/MDXComponents.js` - pass your own JSX code or React component by specifying it over here. You can then call them directly in the `.mdx` or `.md` file. By default, a custom link and image component is passed.

`layouts` - main templates used in pages.

`next.config.js` - configuration related to Next.js. You need to adapt the Content Security Policy if you want to load scripts, images etc. from other domains.
